# PJ's Plant Planner

An app to help keep track of what I've planted where and when.

# Plant Icons

I've got a basic icon, but it's nothing special. This should really be something that
can be greyed out (or some other colour)  when no planted date is set. This will give a
handy visual clue for what plants are or aren't active.

# To Do

- Add the ability to save and load maps.
- (Sorta) Make some nicer icons for plants. I might turn this into a drop down of plant types to
choose when adding.
- Colour plant icons based on whether they are planted or not.
- Add some validation of the date so the planted time actually is a date.
- Add drawing of shapes and changing up colours so the map is more customisable.
