# PJ's Plant Planner

An app to help keep track of what I've planted where and when.

# Getting Started

There's some packages used for dev, but the application itself doesn't require any special
additions. Just launch main.py using your tool of choice.

For example: `uv run main.py`

## The Basics

From there, the interface should start to look pretty familiar. Here's some suggestions to
get started:

1. Open the "File" menu and click "New File"
2. Open the "Plants" menu and click "Add Plant"
3. Give it a name and a planted date.
4. Click and drag the new plant around on the map

## Importing a background

Granted, a white screen isn't much of a map. You can use the "Map" menu to import an image file
to use as the background. File formats have not been rigorously tested, PNG is recommended.

## Listing Plants

You can see a complete list of what you've planted by opening the "Plants" menu and selecting
"List Plants".

## Saving and Loading

In the "File" menu you can save and load maps just as you would expect. Call these files whatever
you want and keep them where ever you want. It's a really simple text file that can be viewed and
passed around to your heart's content.

# To Do

- Make some nicer icons for plants. I might turn this into a drop down of plant types to
choose when adding.
- Add validation of the date so the planted time actually is a date.
- Add the ability to undo (and possibly also redo) changes to the map.
- Add the ability to modify plants in the list plant window.
- Add the ability to jump to plants from the list plant window.
- Prompt to save on window close if state mismatches saved.
- Add a plant popup on mouseover
- Add ability to scroll with mousewheel
- Add a help menu
