# PJ's Plant Planner

An app to help keep track of what I've planted where and when.

# To Do

- Draw a map of the garden
- Overlay plants on the map
- Attach details to the plants that can be displayed when clicked on
    - Name
    - When planted
    - Any care required
    - I'm sure I'll think of other stuff as I go
